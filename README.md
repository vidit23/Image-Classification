This assignment included taking pictures of places around our campus, these pictures are used as data to create the SVM model. We use bagofFeatures to extract SIFT features and encode them.  

change.m - Used to resize the image because the images captures using the camera were too big

Run this -> extract.m - Some extra images have been provided to test the model generated in the main folder. for example IMG_6269.jpg or IMG_6291.jpg

feature_one.m - just an example of use of normal matchFeature function and used to show inaccuracy
